## Why?

Training crows to bring objects can be a unique and rewarding experience. Crows are incredibly intelligent birds, and engaging with them in this way can foster a deeper connection with nature. Additionally, this skill can be both entertaining and potentially useful, offering a creative way to diversify your income stream or simply enjoy a fascinating hobby.

## How?

### Materials
- A bucket or another container

### Section A: Find a Trustworthy Crow
1. **Locate an Area:** Find a place where crows are commonly seen.
2. **Observe and Select:** Choose a crow that appears comfortable around humans. Look for one that shows no fear and seems receptive to your presence.
3. **Build Trust:** Regularly feed the crow and speak to it in a soft voice to build trust.

### Section B: Training the Crow
1. **Choose an Object:** Select a small, interesting object that captivates the crow's attention, such as a shiny object or a piece of food.
2. **Designate a Training Area:** Create a secure and comfortable training area, like a small table or bird feeder.
3. **Introduce the Object:** Show the crow the object, allowing it to inspect and touch it. Place the object on the ground and step away.
4. **Reward and Praise:** If the crow brings the object back to you, provide a reward and praise it.
5. **Repeat:** Continue steps 4-5 until the crow consistently brings the object back to you.
6. **Increase Distance:** Gradually increase the distance between you and the object. Introduce other objects as the crow becomes more comfortable.
7. **Be Patient:** Training takes time. Maintain consistency and patience throughout the process.
