## Why?

### Combat Food Waste
Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted due to surplus production, unsold goods, and stringent sell-by date regulations. "Too Good To Go" addresses this issue by connecting consumers with restaurants, cafes, and stores that have unsold food items at the end of the day, which would otherwise go to waste.

### Save Money on Meals
The app offers "Magic Bags", which are surprise packages of unsold food. These bags are sold at a fraction of the original price, allowing users to save money on high-quality food items ranging from pastries and fresh produce to ready meals.

### Environmental Impact
By purchasing surplus food, users directly contribute to reducing the carbon footprint associated with food waste. It's an easy and effective way for individuals to take part in environmental conservation efforts while benefiting from cost savings.

When you find a deal that interests you, you can reserve and pay for it directly through the app.

### Pick Up Your Magic Bag
After reserving a Magic Bag, you'll receive details on when and where to pick it up. Show your digital receipt at the venue, collect your food, and enjoy discovering whatâ€™s inside. The surprise element adds a fun twist to meal planning.
