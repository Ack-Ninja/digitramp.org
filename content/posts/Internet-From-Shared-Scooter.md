## Why?

Living a nomadic or transient lifestyle doesn't mean you have to sacrifice internet connectivity. In fact, with the increasing prevalence of electric scooters equipped with IoT trackers in cities worldwide, you can harness the power of these devices to gain access to the internet. This guide will walk you through the steps to obtain internet access using the SIM card found in electric scooters commonly found in big and medium cities.

## How?

### Step 1: Locate an Electric Scooter

The first step is to find an electric scooter equipped with an IoT tracker. These vehicles have become a common sight in many urban areas, making them easily accessible to digital nomads or individuals seeking an unconventional lifestyle. Take a walk around the city streets, and you're likely to come across several electric scooters parked or available for rent.

### Step 2: Access the IoT Tracker

Once you have identified an electric scooter, locate the IoT tracker. It is typically found near the handlebars or within a compartment near the scooter's base. The tracker is responsible for monitoring the scooter's location and other important data, and it often contains a SIM card for cellular connectivity.

### Step 3: Retrieve the SIM Card

Carefully open the IoT tracker to access the SIM card. It may be housed in a slot or a removable tray. Take your time to ensure you handle the tracker and SIM card with care, avoiding any damage to the scooter or its components.

### Step 4: Insert the SIM Card

Remove the SIM card from the IoT tracker and insert it into your mobile phone. Ensure that the SIM card is properly aligned with the SIM card slot on your phone. If needed, refer to your phone's user manual for specific instructions on how to insert a SIM card.

### Step 5: Enjoy Internet Connectivity

Once the internet connection is activated, you can now enjoy internet access on your phone as long as the SIM card remains valid and has an active data plan. Keep in mind that the availability and speed of the internet connection will depend on the coverage and quality of the network provided by the SIM card's carrier.

## What?

By utilizing the SIM card from an electric scooter's IoT tracker, you have found an innovative and accessible way to stay connected to the internet while embracing a digital nomad lifestyle. Remember to respect the privacy and terms of use associated with the SIM card, and enjoy the benefits of being connected wherever your journey takes you!
