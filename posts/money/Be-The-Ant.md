# B-The-Ant

**Yearly provisions automated**

*B-The-Ant* is a project that helps you manage your money over a 1 year period.

It does this by automatically transferring a proportional amount of money from your long-term wallet to your short-term wallet every day.

This ensures that you are always saving money for the future, even if you don't have a lot of money to spare.

## How B-The-Ant Operates

*B-The-Ant* operates by establishing a connection with your long-term wallet, which can be your bank account, wallet, or a similar financial entity. Its functionality revolves around two key processes:

**Daily Wealth Calculation**: Every day, *B-The-Ant* retrieves the total wealth stored in your long-term wallet and computes the daily transfer amount. This amount is determined by dividing the current balance of the long-term wallet by the number of days in a year (365).

**Transfer Process**: The calculated daily transfer amount is then moved from your long-term wallet to your short-term wallet, ensuring a consistent and controlled flow of funds between the two.

### Augmenting Long-Term Wealth
When you contribute additional funds to your long-term wallet, the overall wealth within the wallet increases. Consequently, *B-The-Ant* adapts its calculations using this augmented balance to determine the daily transfer amount.

To illustrate, if your initial long-term wallet balance was $3650 and you later added $1000, increasing the balance to $4650, *B-The-Ant* will then transfer approximately $12.74 ($4650 / 365) daily to your short-term wallet.

### Adapting to Changing Balances
In instances where additional contributions are absent and the long-term wallet's balance diminishes due to the daily transfers, the transfer amount adjusts accordingly.

For instance, starting with an initial balance of $3650, the first transfer will be $10 ($3650 / 365).

However, on the second day, with a reduced balance of $3640, the transfer amount will be approximately $9.97 ($3640 / 365), and this adjustment continues as the balance evolves over time.

In essence, *B-The-Ant*'s modus operandi involves deriving the daily transfer amount from the present long-term wallet balance, divided by 365. The addition of funds amplifies this transfer amount, while changes in balance due to daily transfers result in a smooth money weaning.
