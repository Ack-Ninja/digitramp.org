2. Create a designated training area where the crow feels secure and at ease. You can use a small table or a bird feeder as the training area.

4. If the crow brings the object back to you, provide the reward. Praise the crow and express appreciation for its accomplishment.

6. Once the crow consistently brings the object back to you, gradually increase the distance between you and the object. You can also introduce other objects during the training process.
